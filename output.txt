The ﬁeld of computing has expanded rapidly over the past ten years, and 
after surveying thousands of students from Canada, the USA, and Africa, 
we realized that students need more information about this ﬁeld and its 
related careers. 
This Guide is designed to outline the ﬁve computing disciplines, and show 
how they relate to speciﬁc job titles and tasks.  
Information about additional training and specializations are also provided 
along with links to Canadian occupational information resources.  For 
more information on how to design your career, we recommend resources 
available on the CERIC website (www.ceric.ca).

While ACM curricula is oriented towards 
degree programs, many computing certiﬁ-
cates and diplomas borrow from or blend 
these disciplines together.
Many career-counselling web resources do not 
list all the computing disciplines as identiﬁed 
by the ACM (Association of Computing 
Machinery), but instead treat computing as a 
single discipline, typically computer science.
This guide is designed to support prospective 
students, career practitioners, academic advi-
sors and career counsellors by outlining these 
ﬁve areas of practice and providing informa-
tion you can use to guide interested students.   
But in reality there is not a single computing 
discipline but at least ﬁve. Including different 
sub-specialities, there are dozens of possible 
computing educational paths for prospective 
students.
The ACM has outlined ﬁve distinct computing 
disciplines: computer science, computer engi-
neering, information systems, information 
technology, and software engineering. 
Students, advisors, and career counsellors 
need more information to better understand 
what each one of these computing disciplines 
does and which best suits their interests, 
talents, skills and abilities.

Computer Engineers are focused on the connection between hard-
ware and software. A dominant area within computing engineering is 
embedded systems: the development of devices that have software 
and hardware embedded in them. Devices such as cell phones, digital 
audio players, digital video recorders, alarm systems, x-ray machines, 
and laser surgical tools all require integration of hardware and 
embedded software.
The emphasis here is more on hardware than on software, but CEs use 
both for integrated devices. CEs apply engineering theories to the prob-
lems of designing computers and computer-based devices. This is a 
theory-driven practice which incorporates traditional engineering and 
mathematics.

Not every computing program that you ﬁnd in a college or university will have 
one of these ﬁve ACM discipline titles.  For example, we now see undergraduate 
degrees in Game Design, Cyber-Security, and Computer Applications.  Many 
universities also offer mixed majors that combine computing with a variety of 
other disciplines, including Computational Science, BioInformatics, Computation-
al Arts, and Computing and Health Sciences. 
One-year certiﬁcates, two-year diplomas, and three-year applied or associate 
degrees provide dozens of other options, either as stand-alone training or 
post-degree specialization. These programs often use a variety of titles which 
don’t always map to the ﬁve ACM discipline areas.
To make it more confusing, the job title you have in a company might not sound 
like the program you took.  For example, Network Administrators could have 
backgrounds in Computer Science, Information Systems, or Information Technol-

Introduction 
 
 
A Framework for CI Professionalization​                                                                             ​ . 
 
This guide has been developed by the Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC), 
www.carcc.org​, with support by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in collaboration with a 
network of subject matter experts (listed in the appendix).  The guide provides a framework for 
the work of research computing and data professionals operating in universities, government 
labs, and other research-intensive settings.  
 
The domains of research computing and data have long served engineering and the physical 
sciences (such as atmospheric sciences, chemistry, cosmology, and physics).  Increasingly 
research computing and data work are becoming pervasive in all research fields, including 
expansion across the social sciences and into the digital humanities with broad applications. 
Research computing professionals report ever more diverse applications as relevant to their 
work.  Moreover, the uses of data in industry are expanding in unprecedented ways, with what 
is termed “big data” as central to the business models of many of the world’s largest and most 
successful businesses.  Parallel growth in applications is happening in government and the 
nonprofit sector.  Thus, the professionalization of research computing and data work is 
happening in all sectors of the economy.  This document is oriented to the research computing 
and data work that takes place within universities, colleges, government labs, industry research 
and development, and similar institutions, which are part of these larger digital revolutions in 
society. 
 
The document is organized around four broad job families, defined by the focus of the work. 
These are as follows: 
●
Researcher Facing Roles 
●
System Facing Roles 
●
Software/Data Facing Roles 
●
Sponsor/Stakeholder Facing Role 
 
The first part of each of the four sections of this guide outlines the job elements in each 
category.  The second part of each section includes the overall education, experience, and 
skill/competency requirements.  The third part of each section covers professional development 
and career considerations. 
 
 
Themes and Applications                         ​                                                                            ​ . 
 
In constructing this guide, there are a number of overarching themes that emerged.  These 
include the following: 
 
●
Co-Creation:  ​The work of research computing and data professionals involves 
co-creating the computational methods and software models appropriate to research and 
researchers, which is a collaborative process that is very different than the delivery of 
traditional IT and software services that are generally more standardized.

●
Career Paths:  ​The career paths for research computing and data professionals are 
incomplete in most organizations, creating challenges for recruiting, developing and 
retaining these professionals. 
 
●
Digital:  ​The exponential growth of digital technologies underlies work in this domain 
and points to accelerating change in the work due to rapid changes in hardware, 
software, systems, and the nature of the data itself. 
 
●
Status:  ​The work of research computing and data professionals is generally held in high 
regard by the faculty with whom they work, but there are important status and power 
differences between these professionals and principle investigators that are part of a 
larger “two-tier” culture prevalent in most university settings.  
 
●
Terminology:  ​The work of research computing and data professionals is also referred 
to as centered on the “cyberinfrastructure for research” and touches on many related 
domains, including “data science” and “high-performance  computing.” We use the term 
“data work” in places to cover data management, data curation, analytics, and other 
related data tasks. The work of research computing is distinct from, but connected to the 
work of central or enterprise “information technology” professionals. 
 
The overall aim of the document is to achieve consistent terminology and elements across the 
profession, while also facilitating flexibility to match highly diverse organizational contexts.  
 
Among the potential applications of this document are the following: 
●
A framework to guide conversations between HR leaders and research computing and 
data leaders around attracting, retaining, and developing talent. 
●
A vehicle for self-assessment by leaders in the research computing and data community. 
●
An element in the professionalization of the research computing and data community. 
●
A basis for managing the interfaces between the research computing and data 
community and related domains, including information technology, data science, 
computer science, and data analytics. 
●
A foundation for organizational development and strategic planning for the research 
computing and data function in organizations. 
●
A set of thought starters on careers for individuals and a foundation for documenting 
career paths as they take place in the profession. 
 
We recognize that the settings in which this document is used will vary greatly.  In some cases, 
there will be very large, well-resourced research computing organizations that may be either 
separate from campus IT and enterprise computing or directly integrated.  In other cases, the 
research computing function may involve one or a few individuals who combine many roles in 
their daily work.  It is with this diversity in mind, that the document should be viewed as a 
modular HR framework.  The document encompasses a large variety of job elements with the 
associated skill and experience requirements that are needed to enhance research capabilities 
of an institution. Because there will be differences in institutional size, scope, and relationship 
with enterprise IT, the document is designed to allow for many different combinations of the 
elements provided.  Each organization will have unique combinations of roles and 
responsibilities, but it is our aim for there to be consistent use of terminology and elements so

that the work can be comparable across institutional settings.  This is all part of the 
professionalization of research computing and data work. 
 
There are many indicators of the process when a domain transitions from being a community of 
practice into a profession.  These include a defined body of expertise, professional associations, 
specialized degree programs, registration or certification, and other factors.  The work of 
research computing and data professionals is moving in this direction and this document is part 
of the professionalization process.  At present, there is very little control over entry into the 
profession and none is sought -- there is value in people coming from diverse areas of expertise 
and experience.  At the same time, it is the intent to have clear career paths and well-structured 
opportunities for professional development.  In a survey of cyberinfrastructure professionals 
from over 150 universities, colleges, and government labs, professional development was 
identified as the top priority in this domain.  
 
Because research computing is a dynamic domain, this is intended to serve as a living 
document, continually being adapted through use.  The very essence of digital technologies are 
modular (bits, bytes, etc.), with elements that can be assembled and disassembled without loss 
of fidelity or accuracy.  In important ways, this document is conceived to also allow for modular 
use with, it is hoped, continued error correction.  In sum, this document is meant to be a 21st 
Century approach to human resource management in ways that can co-evolve with the 
accelerating advances in digital technology.

4.
Stakeholder Management/Collaborations 
5.

6.
Community/Workforce 
7.
Governance/Processes 
 
Provide overall leadership and vision regarding research computing and data work 
●
Strategic planning -- bringing in the various groups to understand the roles. 
●
Tracking the distribution of power: everything starts with organizational power. 
Understanding where it is and how it is changing as a role of leader. Decision authority, 
access to resources. Organizational alignment and mission alignment. 
●
Leadership/Vision - establishing a vision and managing toward that vision. Also 
managing performance against the vision. 
 
Lead in ensuring education, promotion, and communication regarding research 
computing and data work. 
●
Education/promotion of CI service to stakeholders. This may run the gamut from 
marketing to identifying value of the service, depending on the audience (e.g., end-user 
vs. institutional leadership, etc.) 
●
Explainer/promoter/diplomat. Translator (vertically/horizontally). Outreach. 
●
Broker: Of expectations, resources, priorities, etc. 
  
Ensure the sustainability of the research computing and data functions 
●
Sustainability, scalability, and future-proofing. Ability to broker against expectations, 
vision that this could be sustainable. Making the case for funding, ongoing work, etc. If 
you do not use the proper language, it will not work. Value of advocates to make the 
case for us (not just IT/research alone). 
●
Managing constraints: Using your constraints to create opportunities and focus on other 
mechanisms for growth. Knowing your resources (and limits). Don’t go after constraints 
you know that you can’t change or that become unfunded mandates. Also being 
flexible/adaptive (e.g., if federal or internal funding is cut, etc.). Also coordinating outside 
institution -- collaborating with consortia, etc. Tracking other institutions’ efforts. 
●
Entrepreneurship. Prospecting opportunities. Scanning for opportunities, but also the 
ability to pivot and change to take advantage of unexpected opportunities. Balance, 
though, between being responsive and being visionary -- when is there not

enough to do there, versus when do you find there is some work. Making the case 
for doing something new (or knowing when to step back). 
  
Facilitate continued alignment of stakeholders and engagement with collaborations 
involved in research computing and data work 
●
Collaborations -- including contracts, agreements, MOUs, diplomacy, advocacy. 
●
Institutional engagement -- strategic planning, collaboration, etc. (ties back to a lot of 
what had before) 
●
Apologist: How do we address when something ​doesn’t ​go right and to acknowledge it 
and be transparent about it. Continuous improvement. Responsiveness to the 
customers/stakeholders. Montana: Change, Assess, and Change Again. 
●
Do we need to develop a code of practice for CI professionals? Openness, ethics, 
sharing, relationships, etc. Focus on business/research goals of the customer, 
prioritizing them. 
●
Anti-hubris. It’s not about the CI, it’s about the customer/stakeholders. Recognizing the 
downside of measurement and management (just because you can measure something 
doesn’t mean it provides useful). The data isn’t the goal, the data to be used to inform 
the goal. 
  
Conduct continued benchmarking and impact assessment of research computing and 
data work 
●
Benchmarking, best practices, best in class, and assessment. What is a good-size or 
appropriate-size infrastructure for the needs of the university. How do you 
balance the needs of the institution with the needs of the researcher. Be able 
to help with validation and discussions both with institutional and 
departmental leadership. 
●
Valuation: Assessment/tracking/outcomes/metrics/impact. 
●
Use of BI -- gathering, and using it properly. Managing it -- collecting, analyzing, and 
acting on it. 
  
Contribute to the research computing and data community, including workforce and 
professional development 
●
Being an active community member. Engaging with others in the field who are doing this 
kind of work, leveraging best practices or other services, implementation vs. the origin. 
●
Workforce: being able to identify when changes in HR may be needed and how to 
advocate for that; career paths; and individual development (including advocating for 
your own needs). 
  
Ensure effective and agile governance and enabling processes 
●
Change Management -- especially as the pace of change accelerates. Formalizing it 
enough to provide some guidance, but not too formal where it becomes constraining. 
●
Service Management. See CM above (structure but not overdone).

●
Scope creep: be careful about that. Not getting pulled into teaching, administrative, etc. 
-- whatever may be out of primary focus of research support -- to the detriment of the 
role (or best interests of the individual). 
●
Enforcer: Be able to enforce policies at all levels. 
●
Process vs. Product. Metrics often speak to the product, but the process is also very 
important -- for transparency, CI work satisfaction, customer satisfaction, stakeholder 
satisfaction, etc.

How to Pursue a Career in 
Information Technology
A QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE


--- End of Page ---

IT CAREERS GUIDE
2
From mission-critical business 
systems to e-commerce and the 
Internet, information technology 
is not only an industry in its own 
right but also a fundamental 
building block of many other 
industries. IT has become one of 
the most critical career fields in 
the 21st century economy. Nearly 
all businesses use computer 
systems and networks to one 
degree or another, which means 
there are a variety of industries 
that need IT specialists to build, 
maintain, protect, and repair 
these systems. 
These and other factors are 
contributing to a surge in 
popularity of IT as a career 
path. Six of the roles ranked 
on U.S. News & World Report’s 
list of The 25 Best Jobs of 
2014 were IT-related positions 
(software developer, computer 
systems analyst, Web developer, 
information security analyst, 
database administrator and IT 
manager), and some information 
technology arenas are among 
the fastest-growing for job 
opportunities, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) 
Occupational Outlook Handbook.1
HOW TO CHOOSE AN IT 
SPECIALIZATION
Being a jack of all trades but master of none can be 
helpful, but that approach doesn’t always cut it when 
you’re pursing in-demand IT careers.
Many careers, especially those in information 
technology, require high levels of sophistication 
and specialization, so the more you have to offer in 
one specific area, the better. The trick is choosing 
an IT degree specialization best fits your goals and 
interests.
Once you’ve got it figured out and you’ve decided to 
pursue an IT degree, you can take classes directly 
related to your field of interest, equipping yourself 
for the real world and getting an edge over your 
peers by sharpening your knowledge and skills in 
the exact areas in which you want to work. Begin by 
exploring the four types of IT degrees below.

Digital Investigations 
The Sherlock Holmes-style detectives of the modern 
era, digital forensics experts work closely with police 
officers and traditional detectives to solve cyber- 
and Web-related crimes.
Bringing together traditional incident response 
and digital forensics, skilled digital investigators 
are especially valuable to organizations who use 
cloud computing, because when hackers make a 
threat, it’s increasing difficult to get to the root of 
the problem since there’s no ownership or access 
to the physical servers and multiple databases are 
on the same platform. It takes a special eye to spot 
discrepancies and irregularities.
People who love solving puzzles by taking data, 
reconstructing it and analyzing where things 
could potentially go wrong are perfect for this 
specialization.
Information Assurance and Security 
Melissa McCarthy’s role in the movie “Identity Thief” 
made the situation of an innocent man getting his 
identity stolen an entertaining scenario, but in real 
life these scenarios are far from pleasant.
Safeguarding innocent people from hackers stealing 
their personal data, credit card numbers, and their 
hard-earned money is something corporations, 
governments and others take seriously, as is the 
ability to protect their own proprietary information.
Given the high demand for professionals trained 
in cyber security, it’s not surprising that this is a 
high-growth field. According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), the growth rate for information 
security analyst jobs is 37% through 2022.2
Network Administration 
If a company’s computer systems shut down—even 
for only an hour—things get chaotic. Communication 
across internal servers is lost, there is no data 
access for people to continue doing their jobs, 
customer contact data can’t be accessed, and 
internal needs can’t be processed.
Network and computer systems administrators are 
the sturdy, reliable backbone of the IT industry. They 
keep things running smoothly and allow everyone 
else in a company to do their jobs efficiently and 
without hang-ups.
These professionals ensure the day-to-day 
maintenance, operations and upkeep of computer 
systems, whether they’re on localized servers or 
in the cloud. This means implementing reviews 
and updates of all hardware, software and 
system resources to keep problems at bay, as 
well as running analyses to diagnose and solve 
inefficiencies.
Network and computer systems administrators are 
expected to see an average year-over-year job 
growth of 12% through 2022, per the BLS.3
Software Analysis and Development 
Software developers, engineers and programmers 
are the creative brains behind the technology 
people use every day, including business software, 
document creation, data entry interfaces, mobile 
applications and more.
Programmers write the code that makes software 
work and are usually the ones who love to solve 
logic puzzles. The BLS estimates job growth at a 
pretty steady 8%.4 Meanwhile, software developers 
create the structure for apps and computer

programs. They’re the source of creativity for how 
different features and functions work together. Job 
growth in this field is expected to be 22% through 
2022, much faster than average.5
HOW TO POSITION YOURSELF 
FOR SUCCESS IN IT CAREERS
When you think of today’s most successful 
companies, you probably think of Apple, Google 
and Facebook—tech giants. While these are some 
of world’s most lucrative and successful brands, 
they are not alone in reaping the riches of today’s 
information technology industry. As technological 
advancements continue to be made, the industry 
as a whole continues to grow and offer a broad 
variety of IT career opportunities for interested and 
dedicated individuals. 
Below, a few leaders in various kinds of information 
technology jobs offer their insights on the evolution 
of the industry as well as their advice to those 
considering IT careers.
Become a Good Communicator 
“While technical support has become a commodity 
over the years, the partnership between small 
businesses and their trusted IT service providers 
has remained invaluable. If you’re just starting out 
in IT services, my recommendation is to not only 
focus on your technical studies, but to increase your 
personal communication skills.
“We see a lot of applicants that look great on paper, 
but when we meet with them they’re unable to 
relay technical information to nontechnical people 
in an empathetic and understandable way. IT is as 
much about client services as it is about technical 
knowledge, and those that communicate effectively 
move forward with greater ease.” 
- Eric Schlissel, CEO at GeekTek IT Services in Los 
Angeles
Learn Your Craft 
“One of the largest changes over the past several 
years is the ability for clients to have access to their 
information, run programs and work from anywhere 
at any time. This requires IT professionals to be 
able to do the same in order to quickly assess 
and resolve issues. We must be mobile and have 
the tools and availability to work with our clients 
wherever they may be when they are experiencing 
an issue. In addition, with every change in the 
industry comes new security risks and challenges 
for protecting our clients’ data.
“My advice for someone that is interested in 
pursuing an information technology career is to 
learn the basics of how everything works and put 
it to practice. Students need to decide if they want 
to be a jack of all trades or focus on an individual 
subject in the field. You can either learn everything 
there is about a certain field or learn a little bit about 
everything.”
- Ryan Zegers, partner at Sierra Technology & 
Consulting in Reno, Nev.

IT CAREERS GUIDE
Practice Your People Skills 
“In some ways the industry and roles have stayed 
the same – there are still programmers, just with 
different languages than 20 years ago. However, 
technology has changed dramatically and continues 
to change. More things are automated today, code 
is reusable and there are tools that make everything 
technical easier.
“One of the biggest changes I have seen is that 
there is no such thing as a ’back-room’ position in 
IT anymore. No matter what your position, you are 
expected to be able to interact and communicate 
reasonably effectively with the business. There are 
also less formal ways to break into technology as a 
career or get your next role than there maybe were 
several years ago.”
-Tracy Cashman, senior vice president / partner 
at WinterWyman in Boston
Make Your Own Experience  
“IT touches every business unit and sets technology 
foundations that are as vital as a building’s 
foundation. Growing businesses must take a long-
term view when evaluating IT investments.
“If one is interested in pursuing a job in IT,  
I recommend narrowing your focus to a specific 
area, such as infrastructure, systems, security or 
networks, when pursuing formal study. Nothing 
beats learning in your own playground, so set up 
your own IT infrastructure at home. If you enjoy 
solving puzzles and problems, you will probably 
enjoy working in IT.”
- Sue Spanovich, manager of Information 
Technology at Code42 in Minneapolis
